        <p>During my time in the Computer Systems Technology program I have done a number of different projects
            where I included some down below.</p>
        <h2>Memory Match Game</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="media/memorymatch.png" alt="memorymatchimage"/>
            </div>
            <div class="projDesc">
                <p>This memory match project involved me needing to use Java on Android to create a memory match game.
                This game involves matching 12 cards together in the least amount of tries as possible.</p>
                <p>This game will keep track of the cards that have been matched and the amount of guesses that
                the user has used. Once all matches have been made the user will get a congratulations screen
                informing them on how well they did</p>
                <p>This project involved me having to use both the Java and Android skills that I have gained in my
                    first year of the Computer Systems Technology program.</p>

        <h2>Command-Line Blackjack</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="media/blackjack.png" alt="Blackjack"/>
            </div>
            <div class="projDesc">
                <p>This command line blackjack game was made in Swift. Overall the code was very simple to implement
                as blackjack is a simple game to play.</p>
                <p>This game will keep track of the amount of tokens a player has as they will make bets as they play
                against a dealer. The player will be allowed to draw another card (hit) or stop the round (stand).
                The game will then compare the users and the dealers points and see who is closest to 21. The user
                will then will more tokens if they win or lose the tokens that they bet. The game will end when the
                user runs out of tokens.</p>
                <p>This project was run on an online compiler Replit.com</p>

        <h2>Monopoly Game</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="media/monopolygame.png" alt="Monopoly Game"/>
            </div>
            <div class="projDesc">
                <p>This was a month log project where I was placed in a group of six and out goal was to create
                a functioning Monopoly game using Test Driven Development.</p>
                <p>This included us having to plan out of how we were going to approach the project by creating
                    diagrams, participating in client meetings and doing live demos to out instructors/supervisors.</p>
                <p>We used the Java programming language and the built-in scene builder in IntelliJ to create the
                project. This involved us learning how to use a repository in BitBucket to learn how to create
                branches, merge code and resolve merge conflicts.</p>
                <p>At the end of the project we had to prepare a presentation that we would present to the rest
                of the students and instructors in the program. This presentation went over any of the issues we had
                when making the software, how we worked as a team, and a QA session at the end of our presentation.</p>
