            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p><img src="media/liam_brake_photo.JPG" alt="Face" class="content-img"/>Hello and thank you for taking the time to
                look at my ePortfolio. I created this website while I was a Student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic taking the
                Computer Systems Technology program. This website was created during my final year of taking the program
                with a graduation date in just over a month.</p>

            <p>My name is Liam Brake and I will be graduating the Computer Systems Technology program in May 2024
            at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. During the time I was taking the program I was working as a lifeguard for
            the City of Saskatoon were I still work to this day.</p>

            <p>I was born and raised in Saskatoon where I still remain to this day and is where I will be receiving
            my diploma for the Computer Systems Technology program. I began my program in September 2021, and I
            continue to work hard to graduate in the Spring 2024 year!</p>

            <p>Throughout my time in the Computer Systems Technology program I have gained the knowledge and skills
            to code in Java, C, C#, React, JavaScript and TypeScript languages. I also learned how to use the Bash
            and Perl scripting languages.</p>

            <p>In my classes I learned on how to use Microsoft Excel and do Database management including using Microsoft Access
            and using the SQL language.</p>
